I have thirty-two degrees of freedom and more than one hundred sensors. My cognitive architecture integrates methods of artificial intelligence, informatics, and mechatronics. I am able to learn skills by watching humans and adapt them to different user preferences and needs. I have torque-controlled joints for safe human-robot interaction. The limitless joints in my arms enlarge my workspace. They allow me to provide specialized skills. I have two underactuated five-finger hands to grasp various objects and tools. I can use my thumb and my index finger individually and abduct my thumb to precisely grasp objects. With my holonomic platform, I can move in arbitrary directions which is helpful in narrow spaces. I can even move sideways and turn on the spot. I am glad that you are here today. How can I help you?'",
